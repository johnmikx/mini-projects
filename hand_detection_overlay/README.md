# **Hand Detection with Template Overlay using OpenCV and MediaPipe**

Uses `opencv` and `mediapipe` to detect hands via webcam input. When a hand is detected within a specific region of the screen, a transparent hand template is overlayed on the webcam feed. The project also includes video playback triggered by detecting hand placement inside the template area.
