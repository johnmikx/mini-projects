# This is a comment and will be ignored by Python interpreter
print('Hello, World!')  # This comment is after a statement or inline comment

# Indentation is important in Python, so comments should be properly aligned
if True:
    # This comment is inside an if block
    print('This is true')

    # Everything indented belongs to the block
