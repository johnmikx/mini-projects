# **Python for Beginners - Full Course (by freeCodeCamp.org)**

This directory is dedicated to reinforcing and strengthening my **Python programming knowledge** by following along with the **[Python for Beginners - Full Course by freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc).**

Inside **`Python for Beginners by freeCodeCamp.org`**, you will find:

* Mini-projects created throughout the tutorial
* Code examples that cover core Python concepts
* Practice exercises and notes for future reference

The goal of this directory is to serve as a **personal revision guide** and **practical notebook** for Python basics, while also making it easier to revisit topics and review code implementations in the future.
