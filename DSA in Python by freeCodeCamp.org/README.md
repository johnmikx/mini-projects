# **Data Structures and Algorithms in Python â€“ Full Course for Beginners (by freeCodeCamp.org)**

This directory is dedicated to **building my knowledge of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Python** by following along with the **[Data Structures and Algorithms in Python â€“ Full Course for Beginners by freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA)**.
It includes hands-on coding (Jupyter notebooks), structured lessons with assignments, a small project, and interview tips.

Inside **`DSA in Python by freeCodeCamp.org`**, you will find:

* Mini-projects, practice notebooks, and notes created throughout the course
* Implementations of core data structures: **arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables/dicts, trees (BST + balanced), and graphs**
* Algorithms and techniques: **linear/binary search; bubble, insertion, merge, and quicksort; divide-and-conquer; recursion; dynamic programming (memoization); backtracking & pruning; BFS/DFS; shortest paths**
* Big-O reasoning and interview-style exercises to solidify problem-solving

The goal of this directory is to serve as a **personal learning guide** and **practical notebook** for Python DSA, making it easy to revisit concepts and review implementations when preparing for coding interviews.
