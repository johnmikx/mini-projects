# **Object Oriented Programming with Python - Full Course for Beginners (by freeCodeCamp.org)**

This directory is dedicated to reinforcing and strengthening my understanding of **Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python** by following along with the [Object Oriented Programming with Python - Full Course for Beginners by freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs&t=3968s).

Inside **`OOP with Python by freeCodeCamp.org`**, you will find:

* Mini-projects and examples built throughout the tutorial
* Code implementations of OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
* Practice exercises and notes for future reference

The goal of this directory is to serve as a **personal learning guide** and **practical notebook** for Python OOP concepts, while also making it easier to revisit topics and review code implementations in the future.
