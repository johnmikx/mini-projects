A curated set of **focused, goal-oriented mini projects** built to apply and reinforce my programming knowledge.  
Each project explores real-world problems, simple automation, or interesting concepts using clean, functional code. 🔍

These aren’t just snippets — they’re **small but complete solutions** 🚀.
