# **Intermediate Python Programming Course (by freeCodeCamp.org)**

This directory is dedicated to reinforcing and expanding my **Python programming knowledge** by following along with the **[Intermediate Python Programming Course by freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo).**

Inside **`Intermediate Python by freeCodeCamp.org`**, you will find:

* Mini-projects and examples built throughout the tutorial
* Code implementations covering intermediate-level Python concepts
* Practice exercises and notes for deeper understanding

The goal of this directory is to serve as a **personal learning guide** and **practical notebook** for intermediate Python concepts, while also making it easier to revisit topics and review code implementations in the future.
